<UL>
<LI><B>Theoretical underpinning of existing machine learning methodologies</B></LI>
<UL>
Machine learning methodologies have been successfully and widely used in many areas of life, science and engineering. It is imperative that for those technologies we can answer principal questions such as:
<BR>
- What are their representational capabilities?
<br>
- How can the induced knowledge be interpreted in a transparent manner?
<br>
- How does data complexity translate into difficulty of learning and complexity of the learnt models? 
</UL>

<BR>
<LI><B> Inter-disciplinary applications of Machine Learning</B></LI>
<UL>
As more and more data is collected in many different branches of science, engineering, healthcare etc., intelligent processing and understanding of such data collections is a necessary prerequisite for any progress within each specialisation. Truly interdisciplinary approaches are the key to the success, yet much work needs to be done on how to incorporate intricate domain knowledge into machine learning methods so that both sides of the coin - specific domain knowledge approaches and purely data driven learning approaches - are symbiotically blended into superior methods. 
</UL>

<BR>
<LI><B>  Learning in the model space</B></LI>
<UL>
Potentially huge and diverse data collections can be naturally processed and analyzed in a novel way: Data items are first represented through models constructed to capture data features deemed crucial for further analysis - learning is then performed in the space of models. 
</UL>

<BR>
<LI><B>  Modelling of brain imaging data across multiple spatial and temporal scales</B></LI>
<UL>
Construction of principled models capable of capturing in a unified way small, intermediate and long time scales of runs, sessions and training courses, respectively, while being sufficiently sensitive to spatial scales from localized voxel collections, through Regions of Interest to the whole brain. 
</UL>

<BR>
<LI><B>  Learning with privileged information</B></LI>
<UL>
In many practical applications there are situations where an additional information is available during the predictive model construction phase, but not when the model is used in practice. A typical example is galaxy classification where full spectra (carrying a lot of useful information) for some galaxies are available during classifier construction, but not when the model is used to classify new galaxies (for which only simple morphological and/or bulk spectral features are available). I am interested in formulating efficient  metric learning approaches to deal with this problem.
</UL>

<BR>
<LI><B>  Analysis of population level complex dynamics</B></LI>
<UL>
Many analytical descriptions of population level models are conveniently performed with the assumption of infinite populations. While insightful ideas of different behavioural scenarios can be obtained in this way, if the underlying dynamics is complex, it is not clear how such theoretical results translate into realistic scenario of potentially large, but finite populations. In fact, in the framework of co-evolutionary learning it can shown that the infinite population results may not be directly translatable to the finite population case, even if the finite population is arbitrarily large. I am interested in a systematic study of conditions on complex population level systems under which similar problems occur.
</UL>

<BR>
<LI><B> Adaptive state space models</B></LI>
<UL>
Typically, in order to be able to recursively process sequential data, parametrised
learning models are endowed with some form of feed-back
mechanism. This turns them in (non-autonomous) dynamical systems. Understanding such systems is a challenge. Many researchers suggested to fix the dynamical state transition part and adapt only the readout from the state space. Deeper understanding of this approach and consequences for learning capabilities it imposes is still an open question.
