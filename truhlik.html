Brief CV of Truhlik

A  beetle called Truhlik is my favorite creature.
Born in a cinema wooden
wall he saw everything that has happened,
is happening, or will happen in
this universe. 
He knows everything and it's only an unfortunate coincidence
that most of the time he's wrong.
But poor
Truhlik never gives up! Truhlik's biography was beautifully written by a
wonderful Czech writer Ondrej Sekora.
